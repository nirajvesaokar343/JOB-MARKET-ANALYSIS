## JOB-MARKET-ANALYSIS
#In this project, I delve into the intricate dynamics of the contemporary job market utilizing a web mining methodology. Our analysis is grounded in a comprehensive dataset sourced from US job postings on Monster.com, curated from Kaggle. Through a multifaceted approach encompassing descriptive statistics, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, statistical analysis, and text analysis, we aim to extract actionable insights for job seekers, employers, and policymakers. Leveraging Python and essential libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express, we navigate through the dataset, unraveling patterns, trends, and relationships within job postings. Our project culminates in a detailed analysis report, offering valuable guidance for navigating the complexities of the job market and making informed decisions in the realm of employment.
